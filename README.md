# How many Camels for your boyfriend?

## Introduction
Create a one-page-website with responsive layout and an interface, for example similar to
http://kamelrechner.de/de/male

###### (please work in a creative and original way when creating the web page for this)

* Solve it without JavaScript or CSS frameworks (AngularJS, React, Bootstrap or similar);
* you may earn extra points if you don't even use jQuery;
* Functionality should be given, so a function in JavaScript should exist which calculates with simple rules the number of animals or any other elements you can choose for your version;
* Everything should be as clean and simple as possible, ideally you could provide us with a demo page running on a remote server;
*  Produce smart and compact code and commit your code in a GitHub repository;
* Ensure clean commits; you may earn extra points if the commits are small and incremental, so that we can follow your thinking process while solving this exercise.
